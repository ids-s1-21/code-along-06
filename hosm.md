## Read data

This week we don’t start with any data: we’re going to scrape it as part
of the live code-along, from the website of the [History of Science
Museum](https://www.hsm.ox.ac.uk/collections-online#/search/simple-search/*/%257B%257D/1/96/catalogue)
in Oxford. We’ll do that in a separate scraping script, which is
included in this repo in the `data` folder.

The rest of this document will be filled in during the live code-along
on Thursday.
